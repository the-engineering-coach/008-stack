# TDD in Golang: Building a Stack from Scratch

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "TDD in Golang: Building a Stack from Scratch."

In this video, we use Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build a Stack abstract data type in Golang. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the TDD workflowâ€”Red, Green, Refactorâ€”using Golang's core testing package.

## Watch the Video Tutorial

This video is a great resource for anyone looking to learn the TDD mindset and apply it to a new language. You'll see how the same principles you've seen in our PHP videos apply to any language.

## Getting Started

To run the code and follow along with the video, you'll need Golang installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone [https://github.com/testingallthethings/008-stack](https://github.com/testingallthethings/008-stack)
cd 008-stack
```

2. Run the tests:
You can run the tests directly from your terminal using the built-in Golang test command.

```shell
go test
```

The tests are designed to be run in a TDD cycle, as demonstrated in the video.
